Exploring COVID-19 data regarding deaths and vaccinations

1) Total cases vs. Total deaths - likelihood of deaths if you contract COVID-19 as a percentage: used CAST to change data types for performing calculations
2) Total cases vs. Population - percentage of those who got COVID: used CAST to change data types for performing calculations
3) Countries with highest infection rate as compared to population: MAX and CAST function
4) Countries with highest death count per population: MAX and CAST function
5) Continents with highest death count per population: MAX and CAST function
6) Global death percentage: SUM and CAST function
7) Total Population vs Vaccinations, how many are vaccinated on a global scale? : JOIN, SUM, CAST, PARTITION BY, CTE, TEMP TABLE
8) Store data for future exploration: CREATE VIEW
